# Jurassic Park Pixels

This project is a collection of C++ examples that use the WinBGIm graphics library. It includes a simple game and a graphics demo.

## Included Examples

### Jurassic Park Game

A simple game where you control a plane and have to avoid hurdles.

*   **Source Code:** `example.cpp`
*   **Assets:** The game uses various `.bmp`, `.jpg`, and `.wav` files for graphics and sound.

### Moving Eyes

A graphics demo that displays two eyes that follow the mouse cursor.

*   **Source Code:** `main.cxx`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you will need a C++ compiler and the WinBGIm graphics library.

### Compilation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Jurasic-park-pixels.git
    ```
2.  **Open the solution file:**
    Open the `bgi.sln` file in Visual Studio.
3.  **Compile the project:**
    Build the solution in Visual Studio. This will compile the source code and create the executable files.

### Running the Examples

After compiling the project, you can run the examples by executing the generated `.exe` files.

## WinBGIm Graphics Library
